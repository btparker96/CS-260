    <div id="app"></div> <!--Basically the entire app is held inside the index.html in this div tag-->
    <!--Since Vue controls everything in the #app div, then we technically have only one web page in the app. This style of writing web applications is called a single page application.
      The Vue Router is replacing the DOM inside of the #app div each time it renders a view or component. If you want to use Google Fonts or Bootstrap in your application, one easy way
      to do this is to load the usual CSS and JavaScript tags in index.html like you usually would.-->
